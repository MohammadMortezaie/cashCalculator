    'p1' => "The Percentage Difference Calculator, also known as the % difference calculator, is a valuable tool used to determine the percentage variance between two positive numbers greater than zero. This calculation becomes particularly relevant when you need to assess the extent of variation between two numerical values. Regardless of the order in which you input the numbers, this calculator computes the percentage difference by taking the absolute difference between the two numbers and dividing it by the average of those numbers. This method provides a relative measure of change, which is especially useful when comparing an old value to a new one or assessing any kind of variation between two data points. Whether you're analyzing financial data, scientific measurements, or any other numerical data, the Percentage Difference Calculator can help you gain insights into the percentage change between two values, facilitating better decision-making and data interpretation.",

    'desc-2' => "Add the two values (v1 and v2) together and then divide the sum by 2. This gives you the average (or mean) of the two values.",
    'desc-3' => "Divide the absolute difference from step 1 by the average from step 2. This step quantifies how large the absolute difference is relative to the average of the two values.",
    'desc-4' => "Finally, multiply the relative difference from step 3 by 100 to express it as a percentage. This step converts the relative difference into a percentage value, which is commonly used to describe variations between two numbers.",
